# Attention-guided combined multi-scale transformer-based network for 3D CT pelvic functional bone marrow segmentation
Automatic segmentation of pelvic functional bone marrow (FBM) in Computed Tomography(CT) plays a major role in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with pelvic malignancies.. Pelvic bone marrow near the mid-axis of the body is the most hematopoietic, i.e., the functional pelvic bone marrow. We propose an Attention-guided combined multi-scale Transformer-based network (ACMTR) to segment pelvic FBM accurately for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The presented Convolution-Attention Fusion Encoder compensate for the limited receptive field of convolution and alleviate the class imbalance issue in pelvic FBM segmentation. In addition, we proposed a Multi-scale Transformer Global Reasoning bottleneck module to obtain multi-scale and global attention feature to extract small edge tissue of the FBM. Besides, we introduce a deformable attention mechanism at the decoding path to focus on key features instead of redundant information with minimal increase in computational complexity.. The pelvic FBM CT images are from a self-constructed clinical database of 92 cases with two main areas of FBM: the most intense FBM area (i.e., the most hematopoietic area) and the second most intense FBM area. The proposed ACMTR is compared with popular deep learning models U-Net, VGG-Net, Attention-UNet, TransUNet, CoTr, nnUNet, nnFormer. The proposed ACMTR has achieved Dice Scores of 0.799, 0.772 and Hausdorff Distance of 6.061, 4.068 on the the most intense FBM and the second most intense FBM respectively on test data.
